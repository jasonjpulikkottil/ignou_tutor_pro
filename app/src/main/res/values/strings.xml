Discrete mathematics, sometimes called finite mathematics, is the study of mathematical
structure that are fundamentally discrete, in the sense of not supporting notion of continuity. A
study of discrete sets has become more and more necessary because of many application of
Computer Science and various areas of engineering. Regarding computer science concept from
discrete mathematics are useful to study or express objects or problems in computer algorithm
and programming languages. For instance, to improve the efficiency of a computer programs, we
need to study its logical structure, which involves a finite number of steps each requiring a
certain amount of time. Using the theory of combinatory and graph theory, major areas of
discrete mathematics, we can do this. Therefore, a study of these areas would complement and

	BCSP-064: Project
	 \n 8 Credits \n
The objective of the BCA project work is to develop a quality software solution by following the
software engineering principles and practices. During the development of the project the students
should involve in all the stages of the software development life cycle (SDLC). The main objective
of this project course is to provide learners a platform to demonstrate their practical and theoretical
skills gained during five semesters of study in BCA Programme. During project development
students are expected to define a project problem, do requirements analysis, systems design,
software development, apply testing strategies and do documentation with an overall emphasis on
the development of a robust, efficient and reliable software systems. The project development
process has to be consistent and should follow standard.. For example database tables designed in
the system should mach with the E-R Diagram. SRS documents to be created as per IEEE standards.
Students are encouraged to spend maximum time of the sixth semester working on a project
preferably in a software industry or any research organization. Topics selected should be complex
and large enough to justify as a BCA final semester project. The courses studied by the students
during the BCA Programme provide them the comprehensive background knowledge on diverse
subject areas in computer science such as computer programming, data structure, DBMS, Computer
Organization, SAD, Software Engineering, Computer Networks etc., which will be helping students
in doing project work.
Student will receive Project Guidelines along with their 5th semester course material.One may also
download Project Guidelines from IGNOU Website. Students should strictly follow and adhere to
the BCSP-064 project guidelines.

MCS-031: Design and Analysis of Algorithms  \n 4 Credits \n
        Objectives
Algorithm is the central concept of computer science. Whole of computer science can be thought of as revolving around the concept of algorithm - the machines are designed and fabricated to execute algorithms; the programming languages are defined to describe algorithms s \n o that the machines can understand and execute programs written in programming languages; the foundation/theory of Computer Science is the 53
study of the limits of algorithmic methods, i.e., the study tells whether a particular task is accomplishable by a computer or not, etc. Hence, the study of the Design and Analysis of Algorithm has to be an essential part of any Computer Science/Engineering curriculum. Even if, software for solving all types of problems may become available in the future and the user/student may not be required to write an algorithm to solve any problem, still training the students in the skills of designing and analyzing the algorithms will remain essential, because these constitute the fundamental skills for solving problems with computers. It is like teaching of geometry to instill in students the skills of logical reasoning. The objectives of the Course is to make the students aware of and well-groomed in the use of the tools and Techniques of designing and analyzing algorithms. Syllabus

MCSE-003 Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Management  \n 3 Credits  \n
Objectives
One of the ways of looking at Artificial Intelligence (AI) is as the study concerned with solving hard and insolvable problems using reasonable amount of time, by exploiting the knowledge of the problem domain. In view of the significance of knowledge in AI, in this course, a number of knowledge representation formalisms are introduced. The formalisms discussed include Propositional Logic, First Order Predicate Logic, Rule-based systems, Semantic Networks and Frames. In order to encode knowledge structures obtained using these formalisms, the syntax of each of the tw \n o well-known AI programming languages LISP and PROLOG is discussed along with explanation of how the language can be to encode proposed solutions. Finally, as applications/ products of AI, the topics on Expert Systems and Intelligent Agents are discussed briefly. MCSE-003 is a 4-credit course and the course material consists of 4 blocks. The pre-requisites for the course include Design and Analysis of Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics and programming and problem solving experience.

The objective of the MCA project work is to develop quality software solution by following the software engineering principles and practices. It is only possible when a learner goes about with the task independently. During the development of the project the students should involve in all the stages of the software development life cycle like requirements engineering, systems analysis, systems design, software development, testing strategies and documentation with an overall emphasis on the development of reliable software systems. The primary emphasis of the project work is to understand and gain the knowledge of the principles of software engineering practices, s \n o as to participate and manage a large software engineering projects in future.
Students are encouraged to spend at least six man-months working on a project preferably in a software industry or any research organization. Topics selected should be complex and large enough to justify as a MCA project. The courses studied by the students during the MCA programme provide them the comprehensive background to work on diverse application domains. Student will receive Project Guidelines along with their 5th semester course material. Students should strictly follow and adhere to the MCSP-060 project guidelines.
